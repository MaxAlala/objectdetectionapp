In a directional integral an image each pixel (x,y) represents the sum of all previous pixel of the line with direction d the pixel (x,y) belongs to. This object can be used to quickly compute the sum of values in segments of given direction Typenames _Tin and _Tout represent the input image and integral image pixel depths, respectively (e.g., _Tin can be uchar, float, double, ..., see CV_EXT_PIXEL_DEPTH_TYPES in cv_ext/types.h, _Tout can be uint32_t, uint64_t, float or double ) " alt="" coords="5,5,180,47"/>
